    """Validates the initial piece deployment."""
    # 1. Parse the FEN string for the player's side
    # You'll need to parse the FEN to extract piece information for a specific player's side
    # and their occupied squares.
    # 2. Check point limits
    # Calculate the points spent by the player on the deployed pieces and ensure it's within 39 points.
    # 3. Check for king presence (standard for the game)
    # Ensure that a king is present on the player's side.
    # 4. Check deployment rows
    # Ensure all deployed pieces are within the first three rows on the player's side (rows 1-3 for white, rows 6-8 for black).
    # 5. Check for valid piece counts based on initial purchase.
    # (Requires knowledge of the pieces purchased to verify that the deployed
    # pieces match the purchased pieces and their counts.)

    # Return True if valid, False otherwise
    return True # Placeholder
